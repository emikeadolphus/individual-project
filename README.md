# Customer Demographics & Spending Analysis

This project uses basic data analysis and visualization techniques in Python to explore customer demographic and spending patterns. The notebook loads a dataset, performs cleaning, statistical summaries, and generates charts to identify key insights.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You'll need Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:
```
pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

You can install them using pip:
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/emikeadolphus/individual-project.git cd individual-project
```

2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
```
jupyter notebook Lab3_1.ipynb
```

3. Run all cells to view data cleaning, summaries, and visualizations.

## Running the tests

There are no automated tests for this notebook. You can manually run the cells to see outputs.

### Breakdown of Tests

- Dataset shape and info inspection
- Null value handling
- Descriptive statistics
- Bar and pie charts for demographic insights

### And coding style tests

Code follows Pythonic conventions and uses well-commented, readable structure.
